To unleash their full potential, access to sensors should be opened such that their data and services can be integrated with data and services available in other information systems, facilitating novel applications and services that are based on the state of the real world. We describe our vision and architecture of a Semantic Web of Things: a service infrastructure that makes the deployment and use of semantic applications involving Internet-connected sensors almost as easy as building, searching, and reading a web page today.},

@misc{Kabisch.2017,
 abstract = {This document describes a formal model and common representation for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. Thing Descriptions provide a narrow-waist set of interactions based on a small vocabulary that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and to allow diverse applications to interoperate. Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in JSON-LD. JSON-LD provides both a powerful foundation to represent knowledge about Things and simplicity, since it allows processing as a JSON document. In addition to physical entities, Things can also represent virtual entities. A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally due to Thing's resource restrictions (e.g. limited memory space) or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.},

@inproceedings{Charpenay.2016,
 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web are closely related to each other. On the one hand, the Semantic Web has been including vocabularies and semantic models for the Internet of Things. On the other hand, the so-called Web of Things (WoT) advocates architectures relying on established Web technologies and RESTful interfaces for the IoT. In this paper, we present a vocabulary for WoT that aims at defining IoT concepts using terms from the Web. Notably, it includes two concepts identified as the core WoT resources: Thing Description (TD) and Interaction, that have been first elaborated by the W3C interest group for WoT. Our proposal is built upon the ontological pattern Identifier, Resource, Entity (IRE) that was originally designed for the Semantic Web. To better analyze the alignments our proposal allows, we reviewed existing IoT models as a vocabulary graph, complying with the approach of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV).},

Furthermore, the IG is re-evaluating the current working assumptions of the Web of Things Working Group (WG) based on {\dq}running code{\dq}. The central mechanism for this are the W3C WoT PlugFests, where both Member and non-member implementors of WoT building blocks come together and test their solutions as well as demo their proposals. This document defines the scope and technical basis of the PlugFests. For this, it points to the (draft) specifications that apply, documents possible deltas that need to be realized, and defines which parts are mandatory, optional, or experimental to implement for the targeted PlugFest. Each PlugFest has its own release of this document.},

@article{Wang.2016,
 abstract = {With the application of Internet of Things and services to manufacturing, the fourth stage of industrialization, referred to as Industrie 4.0, is believed to be approaching. For Industrie 4.0 to come true, it is essential to implement the horizontal integration of inter-corporation value network, the end-to-end integration of engineering value chain, and the vertical integration of factory inside. In this paper, we focus on the vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. We first propose a brief framework that incorporates industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed or mobile terminals with smart artifacts such as machines, products, and conveyors. Then, we elaborate the operational mechanism from the perspective of control engineering, that is, the smart artifacts form a self-organized system which is assisted with the feedback and coordination blocks that are implemented on the cloud and based on the big data analytics. In addition, we outline the main technical features and beneficial outcomes and present a detailed design scheme. We conclude that the smart factory of Industrie 4.0 is achievable by extensively applying the existing enabling technologies while actively coping with the technical challenges.},
